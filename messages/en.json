        {
          "question": "How does thinking of my question silently work?",
          "answer": "The process is designed to help you connect with your intuition. By thinking of your question silently while focusing on the spinning wheel, you create a mental association between your question and the random result, making the decision feel more meaningful."

          "question": "Can Yes or No help with important life decisions?",
          "answer": "While Yes or No can be a helpful tool for breaking decision paralysis, we recommend using it as a supplement rather than the sole basis for major life decisions. It works best for decisions where both options are relatively equal, or where you need a push to take action."
        },
        {
          "question": "What if I don't like the answer I receive?",
          "answer": "That's actually valuable information! If you find yourself disappointed with the result, it often reveals what you truly wanted. In that case, we suggest going with your gut feeling rather than the random answer - the tool has still helped you discover your preference."

        {
          "question": "Is it possible to save my decision history?",
          "answer": "Yes, our tool automatically saves your recent decision history locally on your device. This allows you to review past questions and answers, which can be helpful for tracking decision patterns or referring back to important choices."
