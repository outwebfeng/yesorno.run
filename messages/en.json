          "question": "How does thinking of my question silently work?",
          "answer": "The process is designed to help you connect with your intuition. By thinking of your question silently while focusing on the spinning wheel, you create a mental association between your question and the random result, making the decision feel more meaningful."

          "question": "What if I don't like the answer I receive?",
          "answer": "That's actually valuable information! If you find yourself disappointed with the result, it often reveals what you truly wanted. In that case, we suggest going with your gut feeling rather than the random answer - the tool has still helped you discover your preference."
